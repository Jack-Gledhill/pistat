# PiStat

PiStat is a web interface designed to run on your Raspberry Pi and serve statistical information. It comes equipped with authentication, to prevent unwanted access, and provides information in the following areas:
- CPU information and per-core usage  
- RAM and swap usage information  
- Usage information for all disk partitions  
- General information like uptime and local/external IP addresses

**Note:** PiStat is designed for Raspberry Pis but it can be used on any Linux system!

## Installation

To install this on your Raspberry Pi, I recommend you read my [setup guide](https://docs.jacktek.net/pistat/getting-started) for PiStat.
